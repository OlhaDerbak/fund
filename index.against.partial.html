<h3>â€” We stand against systemic domestic violence.</h3>
<h2>Do you want to live in a world where all crimes are hushed up, and each of us can be subject to public humiliation?</h2>
<p>Every day, millions of people face all kinds of domestic violence. Silence breaks and changes lives, contributes to the development of mental disorders and suppression of personality. Everyone should know that:

    Domestic violence occurs not only in so-called dysfunctional families but also in families with an excellent reputation.
    The most vulnerable categories are women and children;
    About 40% of all serious crimes are committed in families;
    Quite often, domestic violence is passed from parent to child.
    By joining our community, you will be able to contribute to the fight against these terrible social phenomena. In addition, we offer psychological help and support. </p.
